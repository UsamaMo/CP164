Using python interpreter on Windows
-----------------------------------

search for command prompt
->just a little program that we can write in python

type "python" pr "python3"

if it doesnt work its not on your windows path variable
just search up online


in python interpreter you can write any code

print("hello World"
Hello World

num1 = 10
num 2 = 90
print(num1 + num2)

100

def say_hi(name):
    print("hello" + name)
    



#this is only good for testing python code without 
opening python program
