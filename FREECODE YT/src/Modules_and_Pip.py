# import anything from another file

# list of python modules
# modules in python that you can access already on
# their website

# lots of third party modules online

"To import these modules from online"

# look at Python Libs for modules that are already in python

# first we install pip, should come with python installation
# open command prompt
# cls
# pip --version
# pip install

# pip install python-docx
"python-docx "  # is a module name
# this will install python module from online
# open python lib folder
"site packages"  # open this folder
# refer to name of module

"import docx"
# to import the module

"to uninstall"
# pip uninstall python-docx
# in command prompt
# and now you wont find it in site packages

"Modules are a huge part of python, so make use of them"
